Note: Due to different reporting requirements between the Form EIA-923 and historical FERC Form 423, the receipts data from 2008 and on are not directly comparable to prior years.  There may be a notable increase in fuel receipts beginning with 2008.  For more information, please see the Technical Notes in the Electric Power Annual.
